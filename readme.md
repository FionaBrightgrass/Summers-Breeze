Aura Share: Automates the sharing of buffs between tokens. This makes handling auras easier. The conditions for automating the auras are listed in the notes below. (It's pretty simple)  <br>

## Instructions: <br>
Create a buff (item on a character sheet) with the dictionary flag: "radius" and with a value greater than 0.  <br>
<sub>...the buff now automatically shares depending on the flags below:</sub>  <br>  <br>
<strong>Mandatory flags for the buff to share:</strong>  <br>
- radius  </br><sub>flag type: Dictionary  </br> setting this above zero triggers the buff or "aura" to share.  <br></sub>  <br>

<strong>Optional flags that can be added to the buff:</strong>  <br>
- shareInactive  </br><sub>flag type: Boolean  </br> shares the buff even if it is toggled off. Great for buffs that only impact allies.  <br></sub>  <br>
- shareEnemies  </br><sub>flag type: Boolean  </br>   shares the buff with enemies (instead of allies). Typically combined with shareInactive.  <br></sub>  <br>
- shareNeutral  </br> <sub>flag type: Boolean  </br>  shares the buff with targets with neutral disposition.  <br></sub>  <br>
- shareAll  </br>  <sub>flag type: Boolean  </br>     shares the buff with everyone regardless of disposition.  <br></sub>  <br>
- shareUnconscious  </br><sub>flag type: Boolean  </br> shares the buff even if you're unconscious. (This works like the Diehard feat, but allows DMs more control over individual auras.)  <br></sub>  <br>
- teamwork  </br><sub>flag type: Boolean  </br> Only share the aura if there's a dictionary flag "feat" and the value matches the feat name. <br></sub>  <br>
- feat  </br><sub>flag type: Dictionary  </br> Pairing this with teamwork, only share this aura if the other actor has a feat who's name matches the value exactly.  <br></sub>  <br>
<sub><strong>note: these are case sensitive.</strong></sub>  <br>

## Conditions for Applying Auras  <br>
<strong>Adds the buff to allies if:</strong>  <br>
- The source actor has a buff with a radius > 0.  <br>
- The buff is enabled, OR if the source actor's buff has the "shareInactive" Boolean flag.  <br>
  <br>
  
<strong>Adds the buff to allies when:</strong>  <br>
- They enter range (either actor can move).  <br>
- The buff is toggled on.  <br>
- A Token is created in the scene, and allies are in range.  <br>
- The aura actor's HP rises above 0.  <br>
  <br>
  
<strong>Adds the buff to enemies if:</strong>  <br>
- The buff also has a "shareEnemies" Boolean Flag. Note: You typically would combine this with "shareInactive" so that the buff doesn't hurt the source actor.  <br>
   <br>

<strong>Deactives or Deletes the buff when:</strong>  <br>
<sub>NOTE: These can be toggled between activate auras and delete auras in the module settings</sub>  <br>
- The source moves out of range.  <br>
- The recipient moves out of range.  <br>
- The source disables the buff, and the buff does not have the "alliesOnly" Boolean Flag  <br>
- The source's HP falls below zero, unless: It has the Diehard feat -OR- Unconscious Auras is toggled OFF in the menus.  <br>
  <br>
  
<strong>Deletes the buff when:</strong>  <br>
- the source is deleted.  <br>
